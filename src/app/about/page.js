          eos is a living archive of event culture: curated graphics from the
          independent scene. What was once temporary promotion becomes lasting
          cultural memory.

        <p className='mb-4'>
          Each graphic is more than an image: it's an invitation to connect to
          the artists, collectives, and spaces where culture happens. On the
          platform, you can explore a map of spaces, browse by city, and
          discover events through the visuals that document them.

          Together these artefacts tell the story of subcultures in motion...
          shifting colors, styles, and ideas that shape how we gather and
          create. By preserving and curating this material, eos builds a
          resource for both today and the future. A way to see how independent
          culture grows, and to keep these histories alive.
